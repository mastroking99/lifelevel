on this program I have a problem: when I go to add a "mission" through the new mission JFrame and I go to save( JButton save), it adds the JLabels with the data in the "Mission List" JFrame after the JButtons, while I would like it to be entered before. Basically the JButtons will have to be the last elements of the JFrame. Some advice?
I leave the project files, they are written in java and I used eclipse as IDE
